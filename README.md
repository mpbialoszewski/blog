# CS22120 - Software Engineering Group project 

## 13/02/2020

We had a group meeting yesterday outisde of the scheduled tutorials. During that meeting we discussed concerns about the User Interface, Design and Test table for Testing. I suggested to the group to share their ideas on our Discord and later on we will decide what the orientation and look of the UI should be. Therefore we will be able to implement the final look with  SceneBuilder. 
For the Design, we agreed to use multiple JSON files (one for dictionary and one for favourites - another one may be considered in the future)
For QA I suggested to add additional sections to the table and include the actions made during the testing AND expected result.

After that I created a Trello Board and added all members of the project to that board.

I created couple of more prototypes with Balsamiq. Compared to the Moqups which I used before, the User Interface was not very friendly so I decided to change the tool to SceneBuilder.

I didn't attend last tutorial because of the personal reasons. However, i did read the minutes of meeting and found out the User Interface has to be worked on even further and we need to implement the ideas from Mobile mock-up. So I assume we decided that it has to be a desktop app

QA.09 review takes in place, will update shortly what I've learnt from it 

[Here's some documentation on Java FX User Interface components  ](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/javafx/user-interface-tutorial/ui_controls.htm "Java FX")

I've started to review all the documents that I was suppsose to read available on BlackBoard.
Here is the list of most important things I've learnt from those documents  
#### Section QA.04- User Interface Specification Standards
##### *Use Case Document should follow specific sections:*
* Typical users - where we should think about for who is that application designed for because every different group will have different needs.
What we can learn is that some of the products do not have multiple types of users. They do however contain one type as we can read in QA.04 section 3.1 :
>For some applications, e.g. many games, there is only one real type of user. Think of Pokemon Go for example.
In that case, this section is likely to be very short, but for other applications it is very important to identify the
needs of all of the types of users.


* Use cases - list all of the tasks (including description to them)  that the user might want to do within the app. Basically it means that we need to describe what the user want to do step by step and how it should be performed
* Error conditions - we need to think forward and imagine what can go wrong within the app, how to prevent certain bugs/ errors from happening and diagnose them early. What if the user would like to do action (A) but he cannot interact with button (B) ? 

I've spent approximately 30 mins over that section

##### *Online presentation:*

* should be a mock-up of our application
* mock-up should look as beliveable as possible (ideal size 1024 x  768)
* content within mock-up should look like the real application 

I've spent approximately 10 mins over that section


## 31/01/2020

On the last meeting we agreed to use Discord for the communication purpose. I have volunteered to read and review *SE.QA.04 - User interface Specification Standards* and *SE.QA.09 - Java Coding Standards*. 
Group also must read sections QA.01, 02.,03 to know what are requirements for this project are.
