# CS22120 - Software Engineering Group project 

## 31/01/2020

On the last meeting we agreed to use Discord for the communication purpose. I have volunteered to read and review *SE.QA.04 - User interface Specification Standards* and *SE.QA.09 - Java Coding Standards*. All of the group is also required to read sections QA.01, 02.,03 to know what are requirements for this project
