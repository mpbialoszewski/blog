# CS22120 - Software Engineering Group project 

## 31/01/2020

On the last meeting we agreed to use Discord for the communication purpose. I have volunteered to read and review *SE.QA.04 - User interface Specification Standards* and *SE.QA.09 - Java Coding Standards*. 
Group also must read sections QA.01, 02.,03 to know what are requirements for this project are.

I've started to review all the documents that I was suppsose to read available on BlackBoard.
Here is the list of most important things I've learnt from those documents  
#### Section QA.04- User Interface Specification Standards
##### *Use Case Document should follow specific sections:*
* Typical users - where we should think about for who is that application designed for because every different group will have different needs.
What we can learn is that some of the products do not have multiple types of users. They do however contain one type as we can read in QA.04 section 3.1 :
 *For some applications, e.g. many games, there is only one real type of user. Think of Pokemon Go for example.
In that case, this section is likely to be very short, but for other applications it is very important to identify the
needs of all of the types of users.*


* Use cases - list all of the tasks (including description to them)  that the user might want to do within the app. Basically it means that we need to describe what the user want to do step by step and how it should be performed
* Error conditions - we need to think forward and imagine what can go wrong within the app, how to prevent certain bugs/ errors from happening and diagnose them early. What if the user would like to do action (A) but he cannot interact with button (B) ? 

##### *Online presentation:*

* should be a mock-up of our application
* mock-up should look as beliveable as possible (ideal size 1024 x  768)
* content within mock-up should look like the real application
